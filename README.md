# Full-stack application for interacting with Twitter API (v1 or v2)

## Purpose:

Using twitter api for gathering tweets, many researchers looking for dataset to apply thier algorithms.
In my case I need moroccain dialectal arabic textual data for sentiments analysis, these kind of researchers totally rely on the amount of dataset you have, that's why I took this step further to build this interface for people who don't know how to get data, althought you may find a dataset somewhere, but you will not find the data with the shape you looking for and that what's push me to creat this open source project.
